#Workspacer version 0.3.2 for Symphony CMS version 2.5+

Workspacer allows files in the Workspace folder to be managed and edited. It also restores the ability, pre Symphony 2.4, to edit Page XSL templates from `Blueprints->Pages`.

##Installation

The folder needs to be named "workspacer". Install in the usual way for a Symphony extension.

##Changes for version 0.3

* THe filename box has been removed. When saving a new file the editor will prompt you for a name.
* There is a new save-as button.

##Usage

Mostly self evident. On the editor page, files can be saved using `Ctrl + s` or `Cmd + s` or `Ctrl + Alt + s` when the browser's focus is on the editing area.

##Settings

On Symphony's Preferences page there are options to change some of the editor's properties.

##Browser Compatibility.

Workspacer will not work fully on Internet Explorer version 9 or lower.
